    "Communication with the outside world from a SpiNNaker simulation can be done using one of the following:\n",
    "- SpiNNaker Link connection.  This is a direct connection in to the router of one of the chips and as such can operate at the full bandwidth of the router.  There are 2 of these connections on a 4-node board and 1 on each 48-node board.  All of these can be used in a multi-board configuration, but the FPGA connection on the same link *must be disabled* in this case, as this can otherwise overload and physically break the link.\n",
    "- SpiNN-Link connection.  This is a connection to the SATA-connectors on the board, which then interfaces with the FPGAs on the board.  This connection can operate at the speed of the interface between the boards, and has access to multiple chips on the board-side of the connection.  There are 9 such connectors on each 48-node board, though 6 of those are used for the connections between boards in multi-board machines.  This requires the FPGA that the link is connected to to be configured to forward traffic to and from the chips on the board.  This is *not* performed by the software so additional development is required here.\n",
    "- Ethernet connection.  This connects via the monitor core of the first chip on each board.  As such it is the slowest of the connections, but as it works hardware that most PCs have, it is the easiest to use."

    "## Communicating over Ethernet\n",
    "The SpiNNaker software extends PyNN by allowing live input into and live output out of a neural network running on the platform.  The SpiNNaker software provides a number of different ways for a PyNN simulation to communicate.  These are described below.  In all cases the external agent can discover information about a running simulation through a database that can be written before the simulation starts executing on the machine; this includes the placement of the parts of a Population on the machine, and the multicast keys which are being used to send spikes and/or commands, allowing the agent to decode information being received, or encode information being sent.\n",
    "\n",
    "External agents can register to receive notifications from the software when the database has been written, when the simulation starts (or resumes after a pause), and when the simulation ends (or is paused).  The software will send these notifications as UDP messages.  After the database message, the agent is expected to reply to indicate that it is ready for the simulation to start; the software will pause until this has been received to ensure that the agent is ready.\n",
    "\n",
    "A number of \"Connection\" implementations are provided to help in the construction of the external agent.  These can be requested to call functions when certain events occur, such as when the simulation is starting or finishing, or when a message has been received from the simulation.  The port on which these connections listen for the notification messages from the simulation software can be registered during the calls made as the simulation is set up.  These details will also be discussed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The normal order of operation to set up an external communication is as follows:\n",
    "1. Set up the \"external agent\" connections so that they are ready to listen for notification messages from the software.  These may have to be executed in a separate thread or process, but the connection implementations take care of this.\n",
    "1. During the PyNN simulation specification, ensure that the connection details are registered with the software.\n",
    "1. Run the simulation."

    "The spike rate of a ```SpikeSourcePoisson``` can be controlled during the simulation, by calling a function ```add_poisson_live_rate_control```, passing in the Poisson source to be controlled, as well as other parameters of the communication if required.  This will set up a mechanism by which the Poisson rates can be changed by sending SDP packets containing multicast keys and rates.  A ```SpynnakerPoissonControlConnection``` can by used by the external agent to send these packets without requiring knowledge of this mechanism.  Note that multiple sources can be controlled with the same connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "The software on SpiNNaker makes some assumptions using the rates of Poisson spikes sources, therefore it is important to tell the source what the maximum rate to expect will be.  This is done by providing a value for ```max_rate``` using the  ```additional_parameters``` of the Population of the source.  This may or may not be critical for the functioning of the network depending on how high the rate goes, and whether or not the source is being recorded; in particular space for recording will be reserved based on this value, so if the rate increases during simulation, recorded values may be lost.\n",

    "The software provides a specific neuron model, ```ExternalDeviceLifControl```, which is designed to be used to output samples of the membrane voltage of the neuron during simulation.  This could be used, for example, to control the speed of a motor in a robot.  The values are again contained in SDP packets containing pairs of multicast keys and payloads, which are described as commands.  This additionally differs from the spike output in that the multicast keys can be specified by the user rather than being assigned by the software; for this reason some care must be taken not to use the same key in multiple different places (though the software will check this and report an error if encountered).  It is also possible to configure other aspects of the communication, such as how often the value is transmitted, the minimum and maximum values, and even the binary format of the value.  These parameters are encapsulated in the ```AbstractMulticastControllableDevice```, a set of which are provided to the ```ExternalDeviceLifControl```.\n",
    "\n",
    "The software also provides an ```EthernetControlConnection``` to allow the decoding of these packets by an external agent.  This is different from the other connections in that it also takes an ```AbstractEthernetTranslator```, which is asked to translate each received message.  This might, for example, convert the message into a command for a robot.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid the complexities of building the connection, population, and all the other parts required, an ```EthernetControlPopulation``` is provided.  This will return a ```Population``` object which can be used as the target of a ```Projection```.\n",
