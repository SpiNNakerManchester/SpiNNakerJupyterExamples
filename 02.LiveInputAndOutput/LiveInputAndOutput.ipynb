There are 2 of these connections on a 4-node board and 1 on each 48-node board.  All of these can be used in a multi-board configuration, but the FPGA connection on the same link *must be disabled* in this case, as this can otherwise overload and physically break the link.\n",

This connection can operate at the speed of the interface between the boards, and has access to multiple chips on the board-side of the connection.  There are 9 such connectors on each 48-node board, though 6 of those are used for the connections between boards in multi-board machines.  This requires the FPGA that the link is connected to to be configured to forward traffic to and from the chips on the board.  This is *not* performed by the software so additional development is required here.\n",

    "The SpiNNaker software extends PyNN by allowing live input into and live output out of a neural network running on the platform.  The SpiNNaker software provides a number of different ways for a PyNN simulation to communicate.  These are described below.  In all cases the external agent can discover information about a running simulation through a database that can be written before the simulation starts executing on the machine; this includes the placement of the parts of a Population on the machine, and the multicast keys which are being used to send spikes and/or commands, allowing the agent to decode information being received, or encode information being sent.\n",
    "\n",
    "External agents can register to receive notifications from the software when the database has been written, when the simulation starts (or resumes after a pause), and when the simulation ends (or is paused).  The software will send these notifications as UDP messages.  After the database message, the agent is expected to reply to indicate that it is ready for the simulation to start; the software will pause until this has been received to ensure that the agent is ready.\n",
    "\n",
    "A number of \"Connection\" implementations are provided to help in the construction of the external agent.  These can be requested to call functions when certain events occur, such as when the simulation is starting or finishing, or when a message has been received from the simulation.  The port on which these connections listen for the notification messages from the simulation software can be registered during the calls made as the simulation is set up.  These details will also be discussed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The normal order of operation to set up an external communication is as follows:\n",
    "1. Set up the \"external agent\" connections so that they are ready to listen for notification messages from the software.  These may have to be executed in a separate thread or process, but the connection implementations take care of this.\n",
    "1. During the PyNN simulation specification, ensure that the connection details are registered with the software.\n",

This could be used, for example, to control the speed of a motor in a robot.  The values are again contained in SDP packets containing pairs of multicast keys and payloads, which are described as commands.  This additionally differs from the spike output in that the multicast keys can be specified by the user rather than being assigned by the software; for this reason some care must be taken not to use the same key in multiple different places (though the software will check this and report an error if encountered).  It is also possible to configure other aspects of the communication, such as how often the value is transmitted, the minimum and maximum values, and even the binary format of the value.  These parameters are encapsulated in the ```AbstractMulticastControllableDevice```, a set of which are provided to the ```ExternalDeviceLifControl```.\n",
