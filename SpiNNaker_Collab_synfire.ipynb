    "# SpiNNaker Synfire Example\n",
    "This example runs a simple \"Synfire Chain\" on the SpiNNaker platform, that is a chain of Populations of neurons.  When a neuron in a Population in the chain spikes, it sends the spike to all the neurons in the next Population, which then spikes, and so on, with the last Population in the chain connected to first.  An initial spike is injected into the first Population at the start of the simulation which targets all neurons in the Population, and then this behaviour continues until the simulation is stopped.  Finally, a graph is drawn showing the resulting spikes of each neuron, in each Population, with the spikes from each Population coloured differently.  A delay of 17 timesteps between each spike is also specified, so the lines of spikes over time are sloped.\n",
